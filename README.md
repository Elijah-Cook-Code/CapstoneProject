-having trouble getting the mud blazor table to correctly show the db info
-the db is set up correctly and im able to use efcore migrations as well
-trying to figure out what is happening, continually telling me the data schema is wrong 
-the schema is correct and update with the migration pushes 
-but still will not connect to the table
-should i start again is the true question
